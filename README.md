### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, your app must dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library.

1. [demo] https://youtu.be/yNI0l2FMeCk.

2. The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 

3. Here's how the app works:

   * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

     * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

### Actual Work Completed

  * Using the same concept above, I decided to make The Art Auction Game similar to how the Crystal Collector worked. Instead of comparing crystals however, 4 art critics will be handing you cash for a painting. If you spend too much money (don't guess the right amount the painting is worth) the critics will be very upset with you, take back their cash, and you will be unable to purchase the painting (you lose). Minus the backstory, everything is the same. Custom made buttons with my personal art are included to give it added flare. 
  * Extras include a button to show all the paintings the player has collected as a secondary way of tracing their score. It also creates a goal to collect all the paintings in the auction. 
  *Mobile Responsive
