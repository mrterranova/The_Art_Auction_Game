### The Art Auction Game

### Overview (Assignment Parameters)

To create a user friendly game utilizing the JQuery library. Enable users to interact using buttons on the screen and update results. 

1. This is the example provided of how the game should function:  https://youtu.be/yNI0l2FMeCk.

2. The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 

3. Here's how the app works:

   * There will be four buttons displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a button, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a button.
     * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

     * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the buttons will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

### Actual Work Completed

* In the original example this game is typically called the Crystal Collector. However, I wanted to include a personal touch to this project with my original work. 

* Instead of comparing crystals, I have 4 art critics handing you cash for a painting. If you spend too much money (don't guess the right amount the painting is worth) the critics will be very upset with you, take back their cash, and you will be unable to purchase the painting (you lose). 

* All the art critics were drawn by me as I wanted to include my background in drawing/animation. 
  
* Extras include a button to show all the paintings the player has collected as a secondary way of tracing their score. It also creates a goal to collect all the paintings in the auction. 
  
* The game is mobile responsive so play it wherever you go. 

* And remember to have fun!
